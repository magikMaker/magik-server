# About
magik-server is a small webserver that is intended for use during the development
of front-end applications and websites. There are quite a few configuration options
that can be set using command line switches, see below.

# Documentation

To display all command line options use the `-h` or `--help` switch

```sh
$ magik-server --help
```

# Command line options

# Examples

Start the server on localhost on port 8080

```shell
magik-server
```
<!--
Start the server using a wizzard to set all available options:

```shell
magik-server -w

# or in long form

magik-server --wizzard
```
-->

Show help info:

```shell
magik-server -h

# or in long form

magik-server --help
```

Start the server on port 8090, set the document root to the app folder and set index to my-app.html

```shell
magik-server -p 8090 -r app -i my-app.html

# or in long form

magik-server --port 8090 --root app --index my-app.html
```

Set the response time query string parameter to a custom value, so you can make
requests that will honour your time value (in ms):
default: `magik-timout`
http://localhost:8080/slow-server-response.html?wait=3000

```shell
magik-server -t wait

# or in long form

magik-server --timeout wait
```

You can also set a global timeout for all requests by supplying an integer value

```shell
magik-server -t 2000

# or in long form

magik-server --timeout 2000
```

Set a custom HTTP response code query string parameter so it can be used in requests:
default: `magik-status`
http://localhost:8080/rest-service.json?status=201

```shell
magik-server -s status

# or in long form

magik-server --status status
```

You can also set a global response status code that will always be returned

```shell
magik-server -s 202

# or in long form

magik-server --status 202
```
